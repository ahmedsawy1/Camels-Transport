Using [geocoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-geocoding) to get address name from maps using lat and long

Using [maps-directions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-maps-directions) to draw directions on map to help drivers.

Using [geolocation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/geolocation) to get the current locations of users.


It's my first app with [reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)., I want to cry to regret those days that I didn't use reduxjs/toolkit instead of old redux
